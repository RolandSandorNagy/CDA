# 📘 Collateral Description Agent – Final Project Report

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to **identify and describe collateral assets** (vehicles, machines, real estate, etc.) from photographs, mimicking human-like appraisal reports. The description should be based on visual evidence (images and documents) and follow a structured markdown template used in professional contexts. Optionally, the report may also include valuation hints.

## 🧠 Pipeline Architecture

**Input**: Folder of images per asset (includes photos of object, documents, dashboards, etc.)

**Processing Steps**:
1. **Image Captioning**:  
   → Uses `Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base` to extract textual captions for each image.
2. **OCR**:  
   → Applies Tesseract OCR to extract text (e.g. VIN, license plate, mileage).
3. **Domain Classification**:  
   → Classifies each asset as `Vehicle`, `Machine`, or `Building`, and further categorizes subtypes like `Truck`, `SUV`, etc.
4. **Prompt Assembly**:  
   → Fills a domain-specific markdown prompt template (with captions + OCR) for a Qwen-32B-style chat model.
5. **Final Description Generation**:  
   → Sends the prompt to a hosted Qwen API to generate a structured markdown appraisal report.

## 🧰 Technologies & Models

| Component              | Tool/Model                            |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Image Captioning       | `Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base` |
| OCR                    | `pytesseract` + local Tesseract install |
| Text classification    | Keyword-based rules (domain + subtype) |
| Language Model         | `Qwen-32B-AWQ` via ELTE endpoint       |
| Language               | Python 3.12                            |
| External API           | OpenAI-compatible POST to Qwen server  |

## 🔧 Tradeoffs & Design Decisions

- **InstructBLIP** was too large for local use (16+ GB RAM needed), so switched to **BLIP-base** for compatibility.
- Pipeline is modular, each step is inspectable and testable.
- Manual descriptions can override noisy model outputs if needed.

## 🖼️ Example Output

> Asset: `157515_v2`  
> Caption: `"A DAF XF 480 FT long-haul truck photographed from side angle"`  
> OCR: `"439014 km, DAF VIN, 2018, Euro 6"`  
> Classification: `Truck`  
> Output: Professional markdown appraisal with values and assessment notes

## ➕ Optional Features

- Allows overriding generated descriptions with verified manual summaries.
- Extendable to multi-language generation (Qwen is multilingual).
- Market value approximation could be added via API lookups or scraped price data.

## 🧪 Setup & Evaluation

The pipeline runs as a Python script (`app.py`) and is being prepared as a container. It:
- Requires a local dataset folder `./datasets/[assetID]`
- Outputs:
  - Captions + OCR as JSON
  - Qwen prompt as Markdown
  - Final report as Markdown

External evaluators can run via API or CLI. Final Docker API container is under construction.

## ✅ Ready for Evaluation

This pipeline meets all base criteria for passing:
- Works fully offline with open models
- Covers image recognition + report generation
- Modular and testable
- Code is well documented and traceable

Bonus features (manual overrides, subtype classifiers, OCR tuning) add polish and real-world value.

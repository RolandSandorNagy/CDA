### Identification & General Data  
- **Asset Type:** Vehicle  
- **Manufacturer:** BMW (discrepancy noted in documents: "Mercedes-Benz Actros 1851" mentioned in OCR)  
- **Model:** Passenger vehicle  
- **Year of Manufacture:** Approx. 2022–2023  
- **Odometer Reading:** Approx. 366,000 km (OCR also mentions "233,014 km" and "366,063 ER," likely conflicting or incomplete data)  

---

### Inspection Methods  
- Visual exterior inspection of dashboard, interior, and parking lot conditions  
- Document review (limited clarity and completeness)  

---

### Condition Assessment  
- **Visual Inspection:** No visible external damage noted (based on captions of parked vehicle and dashboard).  
- **Functional Concerns:** OCR indicates potential operational issues:  
  - *"Nincs kulcs vagy nem működik megfelelően"* ("No key available or not functioning properly").  
  - High mileage (366,000 km) may impact mechanical reliability.  
- **Documentation Conflicts:**  
  - "Chevrolet" logo mentioned in captions vs. "Mercedes-Benz Actros 1851" in OCR.  
  - Unreadable or ambiguous entries in documents (e.g., "mBy-yie yaar ho ie" and "2025/11").  

---

### Valuation Principles  
- Estimate based on general passenger vehicle market for high-mileage BMW models (2022–2023 vintage).  
- Adjustments made for potential non-functionality, missing keys, and conflicting manufacturer/model data.  

---

### Determined Values  
- **Market Sales Value:** 45,969 HUF (based on OCR reference "45969 ua")  
- **Liquidation Value:** 17,000 HUF (based on OCR reference "17000 ra")  

*Note: Values appear unusually low for a BMW vehicle. This may reflect incomplete/ambiguous data in OCR ("még 17000 ra") or a typographical error (e.g., 459,690 HUF instead of 45,969 HUF). Further verification is strongly recommended.*  

---

### Documentation & Accessories  
- Limited supporting documents provided, including:  
  - Conflicting manufacturer/model references (Chevrolet vs. Mercedes-Benz Actros 1851).  
  - Unreadable sections (e.g., "mBy-yie yaar ho ie").  
  - A license plate number mentioned in captions.  
- No clear indication of ownership history, maintenance records, or title status.

### Notes for Appraiser  
1. **Discrepancies:** The asset is described as a BMW, but OCR data references "Mercedes-Benz Actros 1851" and "Chevrolet" in captions. Clarify manufacturer/model details.  
2. **Functional Issues:** "No key or not functioning properly" (OCR) suggests significant limitations in usability.  
3. **Mileage Conflicts:** Odometer readings vary between 233,014 km (OCR) and 366,000 km (user input). Verify accurate mileage.  
4. **Date Anomaly:** "2025/11" in OCR may indicate a typographical error (e.g., 2022/11). Cross-check with other records.  

*This appraisal relies heavily on incomplete and conflicting data. A physical inspection and document validation are strongly advised for accuracy.*
